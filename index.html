		<h1>Agile Manifesto </h1>
		<p>is the foundation of most modern methodologies of project management. It has four core values supplemented by 12 principles. Project managers make use of these principles to deliver extraordinary products, with both value and quality, while staying within the given constraints of the project.</p>

		<h2>4 core values of Agile</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>1. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools</h3>
		<br>
		<p>The first value in the Agile Manifesto is “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.” Valuing people more highly than processes or tools is easy to understand because it is the people who respond to business needs and drive the development process. If the process or the tools drive development, the team is less responsive to change and less likely to meet customer needs. Communication is an example of the difference between valuing individuals versus process. In the case of individuals, communication is fluid and happens when a need arises. In the case of process, communication is scheduled and requires specific content.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>2. Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Historically, enormous amounts of time were spent on documenting the product for development and ultimate delivery. Technical specifications, technical requirements, technical prospectus, interface design documents, test plans, documentation plans, and approvals required for each. The list was extensive and was a cause for the long delays in development. Agile does not eliminate documentation, but it streamlines it in a form that gives the developer what is needed to do the work without getting bogged down in minutiae. Agile documents requirements as user stories, which are sufficient for a software developer to begin the task of building a new function.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>3. Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Negotiation is the period when the customer and the product manager work out the details of a delivery, with points along the way where the details may be renegotiated. Collaboration is a different creature entirely. With development models such as Waterfall, customers negotiate the requirements for the product, often in great detail, prior to any work starting. This meant the customer was involved in the process of development before development began and after it was completed, but not during the process. The Agile Manifesto describes a customer who is engaged and collaborates throughout the development process, making. This makes it far easier for development to meet their needs of the customer. Agile methods may include the customer at intervals for periodic demos, but a project could just as easily have an end-user as a daily part of the team and attending all meetings, ensuring the product meets the business needs of the customer.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>4. Responding to Change Over Following a Plan</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Traditional software development consider change as an expense, so it was to be avoided. The intention was to develop detailed, elaborate plans, with a defined set of features and with everything, generally, having as high a priority as everything else, and with a large number of many dependencies on delivering in a certain order so that the team can work on the next piece of the puzzle. </p>
		<br>
		<h1>The 12 Agile Manifesto Principles:</h1>
		<br>
		<p>1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery – Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.</p>
		<p>2. Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process – The ability to avoid delays  when a requirement or feature request changes.</p>
		<p>3. Frequent delivery of working software – Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.</p>
		<p>4. Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project – Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.</p>
		<p>5. Support, trust, and motivate the people involved – Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams.</p>
		<p>6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation – That's because with face-to-face conversation we won't have a problem about connectivity in interacting with our team we can work fast and efficient if we have face-to-face consultation after conveying information we can move on to the project we are working</p>
		<p>7. Working software is the primary measure of progress – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress</p>
		<p>8. Agile processes promote sustainable development – Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.</p>
		<p>9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility – Having the team reflect at regular intervals on how to become more effective, then tuning and adjusting behavior accordingly.</p>
		<p>10. Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential – Measuring progress by the amount of completed work.</p>
		<p>11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams – Continually seeking excellence.</p>
		<p>12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly – Harnessing change for a competitive advantage.</p>
